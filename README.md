# String-Utilities
This repository contains three Python functions designed to perform various string operations:  Palindrome Checker (fun1), Most Frequent Character Finder (fun2) and Character Counter (fun3).\

Palindrome Checker (fun1): Checks if a given string is a palindrome. The function converts the string to lowercase and removes spaces before checking if the reversed string is equal to the original.

Most Frequent Character Finder (fun2): Finds the most frequent letter or digit in a string. It ignores characters that are neither letters nor digits. If no letters or digits are found, it returns None

Character Counter (fun3): Counts the number of letters, spaces, and digits in a string. It returns these counts as a tuple
